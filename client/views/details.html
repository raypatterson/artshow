      <h4>Don't criticize.</h4>
      <p>
        As a patron of the arts, it's easy to be negative. 
        <br>Be positive.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't offend.</h4>
      <p>
        As an artist, it's tempting to challenge the status quo. 
        <br>Keep the art within the bounds of good taste. 
        <br>If you are in doubt as to whether your art is offensive, contact the organizers.
      </p>

    <li>
      <h4>Don't destroy.</h4>
      <p>
        Fires are not allowed. 
        <br>Neither are floods, toxic fumes, electromagnetic pulses, or smashed watermelons.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Don't not fit though a standard doorway.</h4>
      <p>
        Expect to be responsible for removing your art after the show. 
        <br>If you need to assemble it, make sure you can disassemble it after.
